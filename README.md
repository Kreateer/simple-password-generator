# Simple Password Generator

This is a really simple password generator that I made to save myself time and effort to think of passwords.

I used [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI) to create a minimal GUI for the program.

### NOTE: If you intend to clone and build it yourself, you can use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) to create an .exe file.
